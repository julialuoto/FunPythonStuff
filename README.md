This game was a Final project for CS 101 at Colorado School of Mines. It impressed the professor so much that I was invited to show it off at the computer science 
innovation fair at the end of the semester. 

Game instructions:

Start scene
-	When the code is run start scene appears on the screen, you can choose to start typing your username (if you don’t write a username game will automatically 
give you a name “NERD#”)
-	You can choose to start the game by clicking on the “Start game” button.
-	Or you can choose to go to the leaderboard scene where you will see all previous players scores printed

Game scene
-	Once you have started the game you can move your spaceship with the arrow keys
-	Space bar shoots lasers. The goal is to shoot as many meteors as possible and not let any get passed you. 
-	Shift reloads your ammo but be careful, reload has a wait time of couple of seconds so make sure you reload before you run out of ammo!
-	You will lose health if meteors get passed you
-	You will die immediately if you crash into a meteor
-	The game will get progressively harder until you reach a score of a 100 which is when it’s just an infinity game

Leaderboard scene
-	Here you can view the scores of previous players, it will only show the top 15
-	All scores are stored in the leaderboard.csv so your score can be seen there even after you close the game and rerun it
